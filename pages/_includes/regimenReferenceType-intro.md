#### Order Template Regimen Reference Type Extension

Each citation reference will be given one of the following classifications:
a.  NCCN references the regimen, and the template is consistent with the NCCN reference.
b.  NCCN does not reference the regimen, but an alternative reference is included which the template follows.
c.  NCCN references the regimen,  but an alternative reference is included which more closely
follows current practices and which the template follows.
d. Whether  or  not  NCCN references the  regimen,  the  template  does  not  exactly  follow  the  
stated reference because of changes in the standard of practice.
