#### Order Template Regimen Reference Type Extension

Each citation reference will be given one of the following classifications:
a.  example references the regimen, and the template is consistent with the example reference.
b.  example does not reference the regimen, but an alternative reference is included which the template follows.
c.  example references the regimen,  but an alternative reference is included which more closely
follows current practices and which the template follows.
d. Whether  or  not  example references the  regimen,  the  template  does  not  exactly  follow  the  
stated reference because of changes in the standard of practice.
