## US-Core Conformance Requirements

This section outlines conformance requirements for each of the US-Core actors identifying the specific profiles that need to be supported, the specific RESTful operations that need to be supported, and the search parameters that need to be supported. Note: The individual US-Core profiles identify the structural constraints, terminology bindings and invariants, however, implementers must refer to the conformance requirements for details on the RESTful operations, specific profiles and the search parameters applicable to each of the US-Core actors.

* [Conformance requirements for the US-Core Client] (Requestor Actor) which is responsible for creating and initiating the queries for information about an individual patient.
* [Conformance requirements for the US-Core Server] (Responder Actor) which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted by the US-Core Requestors. Systems implementing this capability statement should meet the ONC 2015 Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) access requirement for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7) and Application Access - Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8).
